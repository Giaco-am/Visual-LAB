1.1) ABSTRACT
    -> Retinal degenerate (R-Deg) rats with retinal transplant (R-Tran) in 1 eye;
    -> In rats with R-Tran, visual responses were preserved in trasplanted eyes at late stages of R-Deg;
    -> Contrinbutions from the fellow eye to the optokinetic tracking response can be limited by Optodrum.

1.2) INTRODUCTION
    -> Optokinetic response helps reduce the movement of the images of the external world across the retina;
    -> Head-tracking (HT) test scores the total time spent tracking movements therefore establishing a measure of visual function;
        -> By varying stripe width a measure of visual acuity can be established.
    -> Only pigmented rats 
    

1.3) MATERIALS AND METHODS    
    -> COMPARING ORIGINAL HT METHOD TO PROPOSED ONE:
        -> OG: 
           - Rotating drum with alternating high-contrast stripes of 3 different spatial frequencies (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 cycles/degree);
           - Allows free movement of the animal;
           - Both eyes are exposed to optokinetic stimulus ( presumption that each eye responds primarily to movement in one direction only) => contribuiton of both eyes cannot be ruled out.
        -> PROPOSED (fig. 1):
           - Rotating drum with alternating high-contrast stripes of 3 different spatial frequencies (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 cycles/degree);
           - Half of rotating drum is evenly illuminated, other half rotates behind a stationary black wall;
           - The animal is placed in a tube and preventively trained to not crawl out of it.
           => Only one eye responds to OptoKin stimuli.

    -> Rats are tested for 4 min during one session, 2 min for each eye, 1 min for each direction of the striped drum;
    -> Time spent turning the head following the drum's rotation is recorded as 'head-tracking';
    -> Two different stripes widths correspond to two grating frequencies of .25 cycles/deg (1 cm, medium stripes), and .125 cycles/deg (2cm, large stripes); 
       Costant rotational speed = 2 turns per minute of the drum (12Â°/s).

    -> OPTOKINETIC TESTING PROTOCOL
        -> 120-day old normal pigmented Long Evans rats and 135-/205- day old transgenetic pigmented s334ter-line-3 R-Deg rats;
        -> Animals were tested WEEKLY (avoiding habituated behaviour) from 130 to 240 days of age  (all animals were already accustomed to the apparatus);
        -> Total HT score (both temporonasal, nasotemporal) for each eye was computed;
        -> A head turn was scored only when speed of tracking matched speed of rotation;
        -> OF NOTE: .125 cycles/deg provided the most robust HT response.
        -> Paired t-test, two tailed for statistical comparisons.


1.4) RESULTS
    -> Highly asymmetrical HT score (P<0.001) was observed when comparing responses to rotation of the drum in NASOTEMPORAL vs the much stronger response to TEMPORONASAL direction (Figs. 2-4);
    -> Less pronunced difference between clockwise/ counter-clockwise (but still more pronunced than the one observed in OG app.);
    -> With proposed app., HT score of mainly monocular nasotemporal stimulation was lower than the HT score of binocular testing;
    -> At early age (135 days) S334ter-line-3 rats showed a considerable level of visual function and robust HT response (Fig. 3). At this age HT scores were the same in OG and Proposed app.;
    -> At later stage of degeneration of S334ter-3 rats (after 205 days) HT score of temporonasal stimulation was reduced (Fig.4).


1.5) DISCUSSION

    -> The proposed apparatus showed better monocular visual behavioural testing in rats;
    -> During monocular visual behavioral testing, the HT scores for nasotemporal and temporonasal stimulation are highly asymmetric;
    -> When both eyes are simultaneously exposed to the stimulus (one eye is stimulated in a nasotemporal direction and the other is
       stimulated temporonasally) the degree of asymmetry (counterclockwise versus clockwise rotation) is attenuated in all
       the rats tested.  
             |
             -> hp: observed HT response is mostly derived or driven by the eye receiving the temporonasal stimulation.
    -> If the rats move, the distances to the drum stripes and thus the apparent rotatation speed will be slightly different for each eye and regardless
       of the direction of drum rotation, tracking in the preferred direction (TEMPORONASAL) is happening with either one of the eyes!   MAYBE WE COULD SET UP THE SCREEN TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS!
