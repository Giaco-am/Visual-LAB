OPTODRUM
APPARATUS ---> T04:  - Rotating drum with alternating high-contrast stripes of 3 different spatial frequencies (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 cycles/degree);
                     - Half of rotating drum is evenly illuminated, other half rotates behind a stationary black wall;
                     - The animal is placed in a tube and preventively trained to not crawl out of it.

            -> D05:  - The testing chamber is created by attaching four inward-facing LCD computer monitors to a frame;
                     - Gratings on the monitors are reflected by floor and ceiling mirrors;
                     - The animal is placed on a small circular platform on a stand in the middleof the chamber where it's free to move.

            -> CN08: - A projector and a laptop are mounted on a motorized rotating stage suspended 2 meters above the floor, with the optical axis of the projector coincident with
                       both the axis of rotation of the stage and the axis of a white cylindrical test chamber at the floor level. A radially symmetric image on the computer screen 
                       appears as a series of vertical lines when projected onto the cylindrical wall of the chamber. A small window in the wall of the chamber permits an infrared light
                       source and video camera to image the eye of an awake and head posted mouse (Fig. 1B-D).

            -> K13: - (Prusky et al. 2004) A rotating cylinder covered with a vertical sine wave grating was calculated and drawn in virtual three-dimensional (3-D) 
                      space on four computer monitors facing to form a square.Whisper fans were used to cool the monitors and vent the testing arena
                      Mice stood unrestrained on a platform in the center of the square (its size is important, too small and the mouse jumps out, too big and the mouse wanders and 
                      shows little interest in the stimulus).
                      Mirrors were placed both above and underneath the box (These mirrors were placed to extend the images to the floor and ceiling so that, from the perspective of the platform, each
                      monitor appeared as a window on a surrounding 3D world). Adding mirrors noticeably increased the overall frequency of tracking episodes (stimulus was present in a
                      larger part of their visual field). (Examples of mice behaving in the apparatus: Movie 1 https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2163346)


TESTING
PROCEDURE ---> T04: - Rats are tested for 4 min during one session, 2 min for each eye, 1 min for each direction of the striped drum;
                    - Time spent turning the head following the drum's rotation is recorded as 'head-tracking';
                    - Two different stripes widths correspond to two grating frequencies of .25 cycles/deg (1 cm, medium stripes), and .125 cycles/deg (2cm, large stripes) (Fig.1); 
                    - Costant rotational speed = 2 turns per minute of the drum (12°/s);
                    - 1 week was passed between two tests to avoid the development of habituated behaviour (P130-P240).

            -> D05:  - ROTATIONAL SPEED = 12°/s;
                     - Large repositioning and grooming movements were ignored and trials were restarted if presence of head tracking was not clear;
                     - Visual thresholds were obtained with a STAIRCASE procedure in which the step size was halved after each reversal, one staircase for each direction
                        of rotation;
                     - The maximum spatial frequency capable of driving head tracking (acuity) was determined first, the Contrast Sensitivity at 6-8 different spatial 
                       freq. was then measured (From 0.02 c/d to 0.5 c/d, Fig. 2);
                     - Tipically, a total of 14-18 thresholds could be recorded in a 25-40 min session.

            -> CN08: - Visual stimulus over a 90 second period represents (Fig.2): 1) A uniform grey during the first 30s;
                                                                                   2) A pattern of black and white vertical stripes (each stripe subtending 4°) rotating at 5°/s 
                                                                                      in a temporal to nasal direction during the middle 30s;
                                                                                   3) A uniform gray during the last 30s;
                     - It's noted that OKR over a continuous 21 min period of rotating stimulus does not show adaptation;
                     - To measure Contrast Sensitivity, the standard black and white stimulus was modified by producing a weighted average between black and white stripes and
                       a standard grey with a luminance midway between that of the black7white stripes. This operation creaes stripes with contrast ranging from 0% to 100% 
                       without changing the average luminance of the stimulus (Fig.5).
                     - To measure spatial frequency response, the width of each black and white stripe varied from 0.67° to 45° (Fig.5);
                     - The angular velocity of the standard stimulus was varied from 2°/s to 13°/s (Fig.5).


            -> K13: (Followed Prusky et al. 2004): - Acuity and contrast sensitivity of mice was measured daily from the day of eye-opening P15 to P35 and regularly thereafter (P90-P125);
                                                   - When a grating perceptible to the mouse was projected on the cylinder wall and the cylinder was rotated (12°/s), the mouse
                                                     stopped moving its body and would begin to track the grating with reflexive head movements;
                                                   - Whenever possible, the experimenter was blind to the treatement and age of the animals, as well as previously recorded thresholds;
                                                   - All animals were habituated before the outset of testing with handling and by placing them on the platform for a few minutes at a time;
                                                   - The mice were generally tested during the first few hours of their daylight cycle (12-h light-dark cycle; light on at 7 am), normmaly
                                                     for 5 to 30  minutes at a time.
                                                   - Uniform grey until the mouse stops moving then it was replaced with a low-spatial-freq.(ca. 0.1c/d), sine-wave grating 100% contrast.
                                                   - Either a staircase or method-of-limits procedure was used, then spatial freq. was systematically increased until the animal no longer responded.



RESULTS ---> T04: - A head turn was scored only when speed of tracking matched speed of rotation;
                  - OF NOTE: .125 cycles/deg provided the most robust HT (Head Tracking) response;
                  - Highly asymmetrical HT score (P<0.001) was observed when comparing responses to rotation of the drum in NASOTEMPORAL vs the much stronger response to TEMPORONASAL direction (Figs. 2-4);
                  - Less pronunced difference between clockwise/ counter-clockwise (but still more pronunced than the one observed in original app.);


          -> D05: - Tracking of rats was more time consuming and less robust compared to mice;
                  - Measurments on visual acuity and contrast thresholds at eight different spatial frequencies were conducted in a single 30-45 min session;
                  - The optomotor system (HT) is shifted towards lower spatial frequencies,
                  - Optomotor acuity is significantly less than the acuity obtained with the VWT (Visual Water Task). For rats the difference was 46%, with a mean of 0.54 (+- 0.0013 c/d), 
                    Long Evans rats typically have a VWT acuity of close to 1.0 c/d (Prusky et al. 2000a) (Fig.2).


          -> CN08: - OKR reaches its steady state form within one second of the onset of stimulus motion and it shows no adaptation over more than 20 min of continuous stimulation
                     (an interval which encompasses over 600 ETMs) (figure 2B)       (ETM = eye tracking movement) ;
                                 |
                                  -> C57BL/6J mice subject to 2 h of continuous oscillatory visual stimuli exhibited a modest increment in OKR performance over time (Iwashita et al. 2001);
                                     with a slow increase in gain from 0.4 to 0.6 and a slow decrease in phase lag from 15° to 8°;
                   - The frequency of ETMs is roughly proportional to the average velocity of the slow component (fig. 2C);
                   - Decreasing the contrast of the light and dark stripes progressively reduces the strenght of the OKR with a threshold of detection (arbitrarily defined as greater of 1 ETM per 30 sec interval);
                   - For C57BL/6J mice at ca. 2% contrast and for 129/SvEv at ca. 6% contrast (fig. 5A and S2);
                           |
                            -> The optimal spatial freq. for both occurs at a stripe width of ca. 3°, which subtends ca. 90 um at the retina if we take 1.69 mm as the average diameter of murine eye (fig. 5B);
                            -> This spatial freq. is higher than the average RF diameter of murine retinal ganglion cells (estimated to be ca. 130 um (Smallwood et al. 2003), or ca. 200 um (Balkema et al. 1982));
                            -> The OKR response to angular velocity between 2° and 13° per sec shows that both strains have broad sensitivity with a roughly linear response over this range (fig. 5C);
                            -> Saccade-to-saccade variability becomes more pronunced with suboptimal stimuli;
                            -> Monocular temporonasal motion induces strong OKR in both eyes, whereas monocular nasal-to-temporal motion induces only a weak OKR  (compare fig 6A, lines 5 and 6 vs lines 7 and 8);
                            -> The OKR is nulled by symmetric binocular temporonasal or nasotemporal motion;
                            -> SEE FIG. 6A/6B for ETMs numeric results.


         -> K13: - Measured spatial freq. threshold using the OPT on P34-P35 CDR mice, the OPT has been used in mice to document that spatial vision rapidly       (OPT = Optomotor Task)
                   increases from eye-opening (P12-P14) reaching a stable fully developed level by P30 (Prusky et al. 2004, Durand et al. 2012);                   (LR = Light Reared)
                 - Spatial freq. threshold of LR mice was 0.41 +- 0.003 c/d at P34-P-35;                                                                           (CDR = Chronic Dark Reared)
                 - Spatial freq. threshold of CDR mice was 0.34 +- 0.004 c/d at P34-P-35 (p = 0.004 Mann-Whitney test, fig 2B left);
                 - Since OPT response is a behavioral assay system that reflects a combination of subcortical and cortical function (Prusky et al. 2006),
                   visual acuity was also assessed by recording VEPs directly from V1;
                           |
                           -> VEP in response to abrupt high contrast reversal of square gratings were recorded from populationson neurons in layers 3-4 of binocular V1
                           -> Consistent with previous reports: -> CDR until P34-P35 disrupted maturation of visual acuity (0.35 +- 0.01, p= 0.016 Mann-Whitney test);
                            (Gianfranceschi et al. 2003)       -> In CDR at P55-P65, both OPT and VEP showed improvements compared with LR mcontrol levels
                                                                  (vs LR, respectively, p = 0.2934, t-test; p = 0.96, t-test) (fig. 2B right)
                                                               -> Comparing the development trajectory of spatial freq. threshold in LR and CDR mice from P18-P62 (fig. 3),
                                                                       |
                                                                        -> Average OPT response of LR mice at P12-P14: 0.145 c/d;
                                                                        -> Average OPT response of LR mice at P25: 0.4 c/d;
                                                                        -> Average OPT response of CDR mice at P18: 0.19 +- 0.01 c/d (LR mice at P18: 0.27 +- 0.05 c/d, p = 0.0001 t-test );
                                                                         -> Average OPT response of CDR mice at P27: 0.34 +- 0.004 c/d;
                                                                         -> OPT response of CDR mice reached the adult level at P55 (> 25 days after LR mice);



                 - The time course of sensory-dependent OPT threshold maturation depended on the age of first light exposure (!!!!)
                             |
                              -> This time course was defined as the time to reach half (T_1/2) of the total OPT threshold improvement for each age group of CDR mice.
                              -> T_1/2 in LR mice was 4 days;
                              -> T_1/2 in CDR mice was 2.17 days (for those exposed to light at P20), and 1.68 days (for those exposed to light at P34);
                              -> OPT threshold reaches adult levels over the course of 3 days in CDR mice, in contrast to 6-7 days in LR mice (fig. 6A).
   
                 - OPT threshold maturation time course in LR mice is best fit with a sigmoidal function (fig. 6B). Single (or double) exponential funtions provide
                   poor fits of the normal  developmental time course as assessed by chi^2 test (fig. 6B).
                             |
                              -> These findings indicate  that the visual circuit undergoes different connectivity states during development, and that circuit 
                                 refinement after prolonged visual deprivation does not follow the same path or process as in normal development.




DISCUSSION ---> T04: - When both eyes are simultaneously exposed to the stimulus (one eye is stimulated in a nasotemporal direction and the other is
                       stimulated temporonasally) the degree of asymmetry (counterclockwise versus clockwise rotation) is attenuated in all
                       the rats tested.  
                           |
                           -> hp: observed HT response is mostly derived or driven by the eye receiving the temporonasal stimulation.
                           -> If the rats move, the distances to the drum stripes and thus the apparent rotatation speed will be slightly different for each eye and regardless
                              of the direction of drum rotation, tracking in the preferred direction (TEMPORONASAL) is happening with either one of the eyes!   


             -> D05: - The Nucleus of the Optic Track and the Dorsal Terminal Nucleus  of the AOS are the nuclei concerned with horizontal tracking.    (AOS = Accessory Optic System)
                       Spatial frequency tuning of cells in these nuclei have not been determined, but they have large RF which is consistent with a lower spatial-frequency preference. 
                     - Independent testing of the two eyes is possible simply by controlling the direction of rotation (Also reported in Thomas et al. 2004),
                       this behaviour is due to the crossed subcortical projections from the eyes (Fig. 4).
                     - Total range in acuity measurements is tipically about 0.02 c/d, which is less than 5% of average acuity values;
                           |
                           -> WHY? -> The sudden appearence of the stimulus appears to attract the animal's attention, it is not necessary to have exentended stimulus durations 
                                      as the relevant behaviour happens almost immediately;
                                   -> Animals are unrestrained and the lack of stress may lead to more consistent behaviour;
                                   -> Stimulus appearance can be repeated several times within a few seconds if the experimenter wishes to confirm whether tracking is present;
                                   -> We determine visual thresholds, which probably vary little from animal-to-animal in an in-bred laboratory strain.
                                   -> Counting the number of seconds an animal tracks each stimulus is analogous to making magnitude estimates with human observers, 
                                      BUT what does a 50% decline in the tracking duration mean in terms od vision??


                    - Cortical lesions had no effect on visual thresholds (Fig.6), this suggest that the acuity and contrast thresholds reflect properties
                       of retinal afferents to subcortical structures.



           

             -> CN08: - Use of infrared imaging to monitor the murine OKR and then quantify the number of ETMs per unit time;
                      - This test was used to define the basic OKR stimulus-response characteristic of C57BL/6J and 129/SvEv and of genetically engineered variants that lack one or
                        more photoreceptor systems or that have an altered spectral sensitivity;
                      - It shows that the characteristic difference in OKR frequency between C57BL/6J and 129/SvEv is inherited as a polygenic trait;
                      - It demonstrates that the mouse OKR can be used as a sensitive and quantitative assay for drug action in the CNS;
                         |
                      - Furthermore, the ketamine experiment demonstrates the high sensitivity and temporal resolution of the OKR in monitoring drug effects on CNS function.

                      - FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS: -> OKR could be used to quantify drug-induced sedation or arousal;
                                               -> To monitor the progression or the therapeutic response of neurodegenrative disease;
                                               -> To quantify the functional response to stem cell, pharmacologic or genetic approaches aimed at restoring vision in the context
                                                  of retinal degenrative disease.




             -> K13: - OPT reports largely subcortical function whereas VEP reflects mainly thalamocortical function and single unit recordings report intracortical function;     
                     - Darkness from birth still allows subcortical circuits development although at a slower rate. Cortical circuits are more severely affected and 
                       retain plasticity when re-exposed to light;
                     - OPT response and VEP acuity increase in the dark and lose their plasticity in response to MD in adulthood, whereas intracortical circuits remain plastic; (MD = Monocular Deprivation)

                       ===> Consequently, subcortical and cortical maturation is not coordinated over development in CDR mice.
                     -  Differential impact of CDR on the "molecular brakes" that would normally limit CP development may need to be considered.
