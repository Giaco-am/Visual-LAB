5.1) METHODS + RESULTS SUMMARY

     -> Rotating cylinder covered with a vertical sine wave grating on 4 computer monitors facing to form a square;
     -> The spatial freq. was clamep at the viewing position by repeatedly recentering the cylinder on the head;
     -> Acuity was quanntified by increasing the spatial freq. of the grating until an optomotor response could not be elicited;
     -> Contrast sensitivity was measured at spatial frequencies between 0.03 and 0.35 c/d.

     -> Grating acuity was measurable on the day of eye opening ()
