OPTODRUM
APPARATUS ---> T04:  - Rotating drum with alternating high-contrast stripes of 3 different spatial frequencies (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 cycles/degree);
                     - Half of rotating drum is evenly illuminated, other half rotates behind a stationary black wall;
                     - The animal is placed in a tube and preventively trained to not crawl out of it.

            -> D05:  - The testing chamber is created by attaching four inward-facing LCD computer monitors to a frame;
                     - Gratings on the monitors are reflected by floor and ceiling mirrors;
                     - The animal is placed on a small circular platform on a stand in the middleof the chamber where it's free to move.

            -> CN08: - A projector and a laptop are mounted on a motorized rotating stage suspended 2 meters above the floor, with the optical axis of the projector coincident with
                       both the axis of rotation of the stage and the axis of a white cylindrical test chamber at the floor level. A radially symmetric image on the computer screen 
                       appears as a series of vertical lines when projected onto the cylindrical wall of the chamber. A small window in the wall of the chamber permits an infrared light
                       source and video camera to image the eye of an awake and head posted mouse (Fig. 1B-D).

            -> K13: - (Prusky et al. 2004) A rotating cylinder covered with a vertical sine wave grating was calculated and drawn in virtual three-dimensional (3-D) 
                      space on four computer monitors facing to form a square.Whisper fans were used to cool the monitors and vent the testing arena
                      Mice stood unrestrained on a platform in the center of the square (its size is important, too small and the mouse jumps out, too big and the mouse wanders and shows little interest in the stimulus).
                      Mirrors were placed both above and underneath the box (These mirrors were placed to extend the images to the floor and ceiling so that, from the perspective of the platform, each
                      monitor appeared as a window on a surrounding 3D world). Adding mirrors noticeably increased the overall frequency of tracking episodes (stimulus was present in a larger part of their visual field).

TESTING
PROCEDURE ---> T04: - Rats are tested for 4 min during one session, 2 min for each eye, 1 min for each direction of the striped drum;
                    - Time spent turning the head following the drum's rotation is recorded as 'head-tracking';
                    - Two different stripes widths correspond to two grating frequencies of .25 cycles/deg (1 cm, medium stripes), and .125 cycles/deg (2cm, large stripes) (Fig.1); 
                    - Costant rotational speed = 2 turns per minute of the drum (12°/s);
                    - 1 week was passed between two tests to avoid the development of habituated behaviour.

            -> D05:  - ROTATIONAL SPEED = 12°/s;
                     - Large repositioning and grooming movements were ignored and trials were restarted if presence of head tracking was not clear;
                     - Visual thresholds were obtained with a STAIRCASE procedure in which the step size was halved after each reversal, one staircase for each direction
                        of rotation;
                     - The maximum spatial frequency capable of driving head tracking (acuity) was determined first, the Contrast Sensitivity at 6-8 different spatial 
                       freq. was then measured (From 0.02 c/d to 0.5 c/d, Fig. 2);
                     - Tipically, a total of 14-18 thresholds could be recorded in a 25-40 min session.

            -> CN08: - Visual stimulus over a 90 second period represents (Fig.2): 1) A uniform grey during the first 30s;
                                                                                   2) A pattern of black and white vertical stripes (each stripe subtending 4°) rotating at 5°/s 
                                                                                      in a temporal to nasal direction during the middle 30s;
                                                                                   3) A uniform gray during the last 30s;
                     - It's noted that OKR over a continuous 21 min period of rotating stimulus does not show adaptation;
                     - To measure Contrast Sensitivity, the standard black and white stimulus was modified by producing a weighted average between black and white stripes and
                       a standard grey with a luminance midway between that of the black7white stripes. This operation creaes stripes with contrast ranging from 0% to 100% 
                       without changing the average luminance of the stimulus (Fig.5).
                     - To measure spatial frequency response, the width of each black and white stripe varied from 0.67° to 45° (Fig.5);
                     - The angular velocity of the standard stimulus was varied from 2°/s to 13°/s (Fig.5).


            -> K13: (Followed Prusky et al. 2004): - Acuity and contrast sensitivity of mice was measured daily from the day of eye-opening P15 to P35 and regularly thereafter (P90-P125);
                                                   - When a grating perceptible to the mouse was projected on the cylinder wall and the cylinder was rotated (12°/s), the mouse
                                                     stopped moving its body and would begin to track the grating with reflexive head movements;
                                                   - Whenever possible, the experimenter was blind to the treatement and age of the animals, as well as previously recorded thresholds;
                                                   - All animals were habituated before the outset of testing with handling and by placing them on the platform for a few minutes at a time;
                                                   - The mice were generally tested during the first few hours of their daylight cycle (12-h light-dark cycle; light on at 7 am), normmaly
                                                     for 5 to 30  minutes at a time.
                                                   - Uniform grey until the mouse stops moving then it was replaced with a low-spatial-freq.(ca. 0.1c/d), sine-wave grating 100% contrast.
