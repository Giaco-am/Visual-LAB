OPTODRUM
APPARATUS ---> T04:  - Rotating drum with alternating high-contrast stripes of 3 different spatial frequencies (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 cycles/degree);
                     - Half of rotating drum is evenly illuminated, other half rotates behind a stationary black wall;
                     - The animal is placed in a tube and preventively trained to not crawl out of it.

            -> D05:  - The testing chamber is created by attaching four inward-facing LCD computer monitors to a frame;
                     - Gratings on the monitors are reflected by floor and ceiling mirrors;
                     - The animal is placed on a small circular platform on a stand in the middleof the chamber where it's free to move.

            -> CN08: - A projector and a laptop are mounted on a motorized rotating stage suspended 2 meters above the floor, with the optical axis of the projector coincident with
                       both the axis of rotation of the stage and the axis of a white cylindrical test chamber at the floor level. A radially symmetric image on the computer screen 
                       appears as a series of vertical lines when projected onto the cylindrical wall of the chamber. A small window in the wall of the chamber permits an infrared light
                       source and video camera to image the eye of an awake and head posted mouse (Fig. 1B-D).

            -> K13: - (Prusky et al. 2004) A rotating cylinder covered with a vertical sine wave grating was calculated and drawn in virtual three-dimensional (3-D) 
                      space on four computer monitors facing to form a square. Mice stood unrestrained on a platform in the center of the square. Mirrors were placed both above and underneath
                      the box (These mirrors were placed to extend the images to the floor and ceiling so that, from the perspective of the platform, each monitor appeared as a window on a 
                      surrounding 3D world). (Examples of mice behaving in the apparatus: Movie 1 https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2163346)


TESTING
PROCEDURE ---> T04: - Rats are tested for 4 min during one session, 2 min for each eye, 1 min for each direction of the striped drum;
                    - Time spent turning the head following the drum's rotation is recorded as 'head-tracking';
                    - Two different stripes widths correspond to two grating frequencies of .25 cycles/deg (1 cm, medium stripes), and .125 cycles/deg (2cm, large stripes) (Fig.); 
                    - Costant rotational speed = 2 turns per minute of the drum (12°/s);
                    - 1 week was passed between two tests to avoid the development of habituated behaviour.

            -> D05:  - ROTATIONAL SPEED = 12°/s;
                     - Large repositioning and grooming movements were ignored and trials were restarted if presence of head tracking was not clear;
                     - Visual thresholds were obtained with a STAIRCASE procedure in which the step size was halved after each reversal, one staircase for each direction
                        of rotation;
                     - The maximum spatial frequency capable of driving head tracking (acuity) was determined first, the Contrast Sensitivity at 6-8 different spatial 
                       freq. was then measured (From 0.02 c/d to 0.5 c/d, Fig. 2);
                     - Tipically, a total of 14-18 thresholds could be recorded in a 25-40 min session.
